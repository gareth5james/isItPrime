# Javascript test

## Complete a function that returns true when passed a prime number and false when passed a non prime number

### Clone the repo, ```git clone https://github.com/gareth5james/isItPrime```

### Install dependencies ```npm i```

### Edit the content of main.js to complete the function

### Run tests with ```npm t```

### Test criteria visible under ```./__tests__/main.test.js```

#### A prime number is a number that is greater than 1, and is only wholly divisible by 1 and itself. 

#### For example, 2 is a prime number, as it is wholly divisible by 2 and 1. 8 is not a prime number, as it is 
#### wholly divisible by 1, 2 and 4.
#### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

#### You can expect the function to accept only numbers between 0 and 200

### Good luck!
